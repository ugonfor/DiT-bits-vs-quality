"""
Self-supervised distillation: BF16 FLUX → Ternary FLUX.
Reproduces: https://chenglin-yang.github.io/1.58bit.flux.github.io/

Four loss modes:

  fm (BEST): Proper flow-matching distillation with pre-generated teacher latents.
    1. Pre-generate teacher latents: python generate_teacher_dataset.py
    2. Train: z_t = (1-t)*z_0 + t*eps, loss = MSE(student(z_t,t,c), teacher(z_t,t,c))
    Use --balanced-sampling to ensure equal gradient weight per unique prompt.
    Use --t-dist logit-normal for better intermediate timestep coverage.
    Usage: python train_ternary.py --loss-type fm --dataset output/teacher_dataset.pt \
           --balanced-sampling --t-dist logit-normal

  online: Online FM distillation. No pre-generated dataset needed.
    Pseudo-z_0 via teacher Euler denoising (--online-steps 1 = fast; 5-10 = high quality).
    Single-step (V3/V4) caused grid artifacts at high LR. Multi-step (--online-steps 5+)
    should solve this. Infinite diversity → no dataset memorization possible (V8 path).
    Usage: python train_ternary.py --loss-type online --online-steps 5

  output (baseline, wrong distribution): Teacher/student velocity MSE at random noise z_t.
    Trains on z_t=pure_noise for ALL t. Distribution shift → images stay noisy.
    Usage: python train_ternary.py --loss-type output

  layer (legacy): MSE on 29 intermediate block activations.
    Doesn't directly optimize final velocity → images stay noisy even as loss drops.
    Usage: python train_ternary.py --loss-type layer
